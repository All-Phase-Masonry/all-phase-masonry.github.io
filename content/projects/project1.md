This project was completed on a beautiful Makakilo home. We constructed a terraced retaining wall using blue rock and installed a new stairway with a concrete patio. We excavated and constructed new wall to fit the slope the home was on. We built a new concrete landing perfect size for entertaining and stairway for ease of travel down each terrace.
