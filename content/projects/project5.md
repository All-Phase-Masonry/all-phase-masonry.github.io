This countryside home in Pupukea wanted to replace an old chain link fence at the property entrance with something that matched their lush landscape.  Moss Rock, a popular choice for Hawaii Homeowners, had the durability and tropical aesthetic that the homeowner wanted.  For finishing touches, we grouted the moss rock with a smoke grey colored grout.
