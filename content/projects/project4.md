What a transformation from useless space to a highly usable family yard!  In this project, All Phase Masonry constructed a 20ft x 20ft raised surface held together by a 5ft tall moss rock retaining wall.  Previously, the yard was split into two where the lower yard was unusable.  The left side of yard was finished with a 6-step stairway leading to the entrance of the house.  We included fence mounting holes in the top of the wall to ensure plenty of options for the homeowner when time to fence the yard.
