### Why select us for your project? ###
We recognize how challenging it can be to find the right masonry contractor for your project with all the different factors that go into your decision making.  Our goal is to provide you with the highest quality product possible for a fair price.  

Here is why WE are different from the rest!

#### Tongan Authenticity ####
Our Tongan expert masons have have been building quality products using our tools and techniques honed over generations.  Because of our skilled craftsman, we've mastered the art and science behind constructing durable and and beautiful rock walls and landscaping.  While many try to duplicate our work, a keen eye can often tell the difference.  There are standard rock walls, and there are Tongan rock walls.  View our portfolio of work and see the difference.  

#### Professionalism - The Tongan Way ####
We treat every client like you are our Ohana.  Throughout all the phases of your project, we work closely with the homeowner to discuss how we are buiding out your project making sure you're always informed and part of the process.  We would rather over communicate then leave our clients feeling like they are unsure about where we are in the build.  

We believe in 'ANGA-FAKATONGA' which encompasses our values, practices, beliefs and behaviors.  We not only treat clients like Ohana, we also treat your property like our own.  At the end of every workday, we take special care to clean and tidy the job site as much as possible.  Masonry is messy work, but we ensure our client's property gets the respect it deserves. 

#### Value in Price ####
We want to give you best-in-class service at a price you can afford.  Talk to us about your budget, and we can help you design a solution to fit your budget.  However, we never compromise quality for price.
